# go-fbrain

I made this project because _"why not?"_.
For the hee hee haa haa funnies.
read about it at [Temples Of man a.k.a my website](https://z6dev.github.io/Temples-Of-Man#projects)

## Setup and usage
You can run it directly by:
`.\gofbrain [insert brainfuck program path here relative to the main.go path]`
OR
`go run main.go [insert brainfuck program like said up there]`

if you made changes you can build it by you know...
`go build main.go`
